                    <p class="small" style="padding-top: 0;">The Fates, also known as the Moirai, were the three goddess-spirits of individual destiny in Greek mythology. They were said to be the children of Uranus and Gaia, though later tradition made them the offspring of Erebos and Night. The Romans knew them collectively as the Parcae and individually as Nona, Decuma, and Morta. As a combined force, the Fates appeared in a great number of classical traditions.
                        <br>The Greek Fates were named as follows: Clotho, who spun the thread of life and was therefore the Fate who decided birth; Lachesis, who measured the thread spun by Clotho, thus becoming the Fate of life itself; and Atropos, the eldest and the Fate of death, who cut the thread with her shears and therefore determined the length of any life. With the help of the god Hermes, they were also the supposed inventors of the alphabet.
                        <br>Usually depicted in art as elderly and dressed in white robes, the Fates may have originally represented the phases of the moon. Although they attracted widespread cult following, only Clotho and Atropos were worshipped at the Oracle at Delphi.</p>

                    <p class="small">The Fates, or Moirai, “...were the three goddess-spirits of individual destiny in Greek mythology” (“Fates”), and are daughters of Uranus and Gaia for greek and daughters of Erobos and Night for romans. Furthermore, they were elderly with white robes and called Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos for greek and Nona, Decuma and Morta for romans. For the greeks, Clotho decided birth, Lachesis decides his/her life, and Atropos decided death itself. They were the symbolism of the moon phases and Lachesis wasn’t worshipped with the Oracle of Delphi. In breif,the 3 greek goddess-spirits were part of greek and roman mythology and held significance for both city states.
